# Review Sentiment Prediction
In this notebook, we take data from https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html for the books category, we transform it into machine readable format and split it into training and testing set.
We then train various models on the data and then export the best performing model.

The models folder contains the two models we exported (SVM, Random Forest)<br>
The EDA.ipynb is the main notebook containing all the code.<br>
